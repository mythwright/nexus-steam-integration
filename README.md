# Nexus Steam Integration

Some people love to track their time played through Steam, this is quite easy for those who downloaded
the game through Steam, but for those who use the standalone client, they might want to track their time as well.

This little addon is heavily influenced by the original Addon Loader version here https://github.com/vimodev/GW2SteamRunner

I wanted to bring something similar to the [Nexus](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) framework

### Installation

Install directly from the Nexus Addons Library
